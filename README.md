Hotel Discount Strategy & Booking Analysis

1. Project Overview
   
This project analyzes hotel booking behavior in relation to discount strategies, price elasticity, hotel segmentation, and room availability forecasting.
The goal is to identify which discounts drive the highest booking impact and revenue, and to segment hotels based on performance characteristics.


2. Key Objectives
   
Discount Effectiveness: Evaluate which discount codes lead to the largest booking response (reduction in available rooms).

Price Elasticity Modeling: Examine the relationship between discount percentage and available rooms to understand demand sensitivity.

Sweet Spot Discovery: Identify discount levels that maximize booking without harming revenue.

Hotel Segmentation: Cluster hotels into meaningful groups such as:

Luxury hotels that rarely discount

Mid-range hotels with aggressive discount strategies

Budget hotels with high price sensitivity

Machine Learning Modeling: Predict available rooms based on discount behavior and temporal features.

3. Techniques Used
   
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-Feature Engineering (Booking Pace, Weekend/Month impacts, etc.)

-Regression Models (Linear Regression,Decision Tree Regression)

-Clustering (K-Means & Silhouette Score for optimal K)

-Data Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
